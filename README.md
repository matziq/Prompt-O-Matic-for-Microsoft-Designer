Prompt-o-Matic for Microsoft Designer and Copilot

A GUI that lets you choose subject, action, artistic style, media, and extras from canned lists to form a prompt to use with Designer or Copilot!
(Designer and Copilot utlize DAL-E 3 on the backend but on the front end, they improve the prompt so that DAL-E 3 provides better results.)

The script also includes a random button that lets you create a random prompt from the various dropdowns. There are "freeze" buttons, too.
If you check the freeze box next to one of the dropdowns and click the "Random Prompt Generator" button, those dropdowns won't change.

When you make any changes, the clipboard will be autopatically updated so you can just click one of the buttons to open Designer or Copilot, or just paste from the clipboard.

Feedback welcome!
