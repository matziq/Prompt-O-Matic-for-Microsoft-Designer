Prompt-o-Matic for Microsoft Designer

A Simple GUI that lets you choose subject, action, artistic style, media, and extras to form a prompt to use with Microsoft Designer. 
Designer utlizies DAL-E 3 on the backend but on the front end, Designer improves the prompt so that DAL-E provides better results.
There is also a random button that lets you create a random selection from the various dropdowns.
You can also edit the prompt before you generate the image once you copy the contents of the clipboard to Designer.
Next up - freezing dropdowns so you can get random results while keeping the ones you like.
